# Basic-Data-Sorting-Method
This is old sample of my college project assignment used C++. This repository contains a simple implementation of a Student Database Management System in C. The program allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data. The system includes features such as sorting, searching, and user authentication.


## Features

1. **Login System:** Users must log in with their NPM (Student ID) and password to access the system.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Users can add, update, and delete student data.
3. **Sorting:** Data can be sorted based on the student's name (ascending/descending) or NPM.
4. **Searching:** Users can search for students based on their name or NPM, supporting both exact and partial matches.
5. **Password Update:** Users can change their passwords for security reasons.
6. **Clear Screen:** Option to clear the screen for better user experience.
7. **User Guide:** Access a user guide to understand how to use the application effectively.


## Usage

1. **Login:** Upon running the program, users need to log in with their NPM and password.
2. **Main Menu:** After logging in, users will be presented with a menu to choose various operations.
3. **CRUD Operations:** Users can choose options to add, update, or delete student data.
4. **Sorting:** Sort the data based on the student's name or NPM in ascending or descending order.
5. **Searching:** Find students by searching for their name or NPM, supporting both exact and partial matches.
6. **Clear Screen:** Clear the screen for a better view of the application.
7. **User Guide:** Access a user guide for detailed instructions on using the application effectively.
8. **Password Update:** Change the password for enhanced security.
9. **Logout:** Users can log out to secure their data.
